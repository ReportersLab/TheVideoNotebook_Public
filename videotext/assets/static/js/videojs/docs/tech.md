Playback Technology ("Tech")
============================
Playback Technology refers to the specific browser or plugin technology used to play the video or audio. When using HTML5, the playback technology is the video or audio element. When using Flash, the playback technology is the specific Flash player used, e.g. Flowplayer, YouTube Player, VideoJS.swf, etc. (not just "Flash").

With the VideoJS API you can control any type of browser-based video, as long as the playback technology in use has an API and a VideoJS API wrapper for it.
